alert:
 - severity
   - info (an actionable but non urgent thing. even wanted, is this just logs?)
   - warn (you need to fix this, but tomorrow is fine)
   - crit (Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to inform you of a fire which has broken out at the premises of...)
 - tags
 - summary
 - notes

service:
 - name
 - handler (perl class)
 - service-specific config (hostnames, API keys, etc)

user:
 - name
 - services
   - name
   - number/token ("to")
   - severity
 - wake times

group:
 - name
 - users in group

route:
 - tags (or *)
 - group 


endpoints:
/alert   - send an alert
/ack     - no more alerts for group? tags? sev? for N mins/forever?
/alerts  - list of outstanding alerts
/metrics - :)


dunno yet:
- does this need to store anything? ideally not
- can we collapse (and ack!) by hash of tags, groups, etc? or do we need to deal with every alert?
- fallback:
 - a "default" group?
 - ignore wake times if we can't find anyone?
 - page everyone if we can't find anyone?
   - maybe do that at boot, or reject config that would not cover a period?
